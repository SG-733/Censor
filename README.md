# Solana Message Service

Solana Message Service uses blockchain and cryptography to enable encrypted and secure communication through the chain. Starting with p2p communication through messaging this can be expanded to solve more diverse problems and the protocol can also be utilized to bring DAO communication directly On-Chain.

## Overview

Solana Message Service aims to provide a platform for peer-to-peer (p2p) communication through messaging, leveraging the power of Solana blockchain for security and decentralization. The underlying protocol can be expanded to solve a variety of communication challenges and can also be utilized to bring decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) communication directly On-Chain.

## Features

- Real encrypted and secure communication.
- Peer-to-peer messaging.
- Potential for solving diverse communication issues in DAOs.
- Integration with Solana blockchain for decentralization and security.
